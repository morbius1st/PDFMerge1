classify process:


prepClassify
	classify.Configure
		> sets internal vars
		> sets var for using, or not, building phase

	classify.config async ...
		> config async vars

classify.Preprocess
	> init merge item list
	> init lock for async usage
	> init collection view for sync using async usage


classify.Process3
	> setup item processing
	> start the item processing as a task
	> runs the task and awaits for it to complete
	
	classify.processFiles3
		> runs through the list of files and classify the file.
		> includes extra operations relative to being in a separate task
		> does not use the return value
		
		classify.classify3  (async)
			> classify a single sheet PDF using the comparison tree
			> is recursive
			> includes extra operations to handle async locks
			> runs through the classify tree and applies the classification tree using CompareOperations.Compare2
			> return true if a match is found - returned value is not used externally - used to determine recursive
			> CompareOperations.Compare2 returns true of the item matches
				> when true, checks for children and processes the children
			> 
			
			CompareOperations.Compare2
				> is not recursive
				> runs through the list of compare ops
				> runs the compare routine to determine a result
					> result is and'd or or'd to the prior result when appropriate

				CompareOperations.compare
					> this is a large switch that runs a routine depending on the type of compare op
					> the result of each operation is returned
					
net result, each child has the items that match its compare filter
